 The word bardiche is the corrupted spelling of berdysh. The berdysh (Russian
term) is in effect an elongated battleaxe with a large, narrow, curved axe head
measuring 24 to 32 inches long, mounted on a pole five to eight feet long.

 The upper part of the head can be used for thrusting, while the lower part is
in the form of a langet. A langet is an iron strap used to increase the
strength of the head and protect the most exposed part of the weapon from blows.

 Berdysh require more room to wield than a pike or a spear, but the weapon has
a unique function: it can be used as a gun rest. The smaller berdysh have two
rings for attaching to a shoulder strap. This arrangement is popular among
horsemen.
