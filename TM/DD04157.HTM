 The spells of the Sphere of Time explore ways in which time can be altered and
perceived. These spells manipulate the effects of the passage of time on
objects and creatures and can also affect the passage of time itself. Such spells
are often the province of deities associated with nature, philosophy, divination,
and trickery.
