  The simplest versions of this item are cones of bronze or brass or some
similar material, with the wide end placed against the surface through which the
thief wishes to hear and the narrow end placed against his ear. Such listening
cones add +5 to the chances for detecting noise. A generous DM may allow a thief to
improvise such an item from the humble wine glass. As noted, with such a
hollow cone it is wise to use mesh over the broad end to exclude ear seekers!

    If such an item is used for a combination lock (listening for tumblers falling
to assist the open locks roll), the thief may well need a special miniaturized
cone to assist him. The proto-stethoscope may be born here . . .
